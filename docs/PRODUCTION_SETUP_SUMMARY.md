# Production Setup Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Development Server in Production
**Problem**: Application was running Flask's development server in production, causing performance and security issues.

**Solution**: 
- Added Gunicorn as production WSGI server
- Created `wsgi.py` entry point
- Added `gunicorn.conf.py` with production-optimized settings
- Updated CLI to support `--production` flag

### 2. API 500 Errors
**Problem**: API endpoints were returning generic 500 errors without useful error information.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced error handling in API controllers
- Added specific validation for SSH key configuration
- Improved error messages with actionable details
- Added proper exception handling for FileNotFoundError and PermissionError

### 3. SQLAlchemy Relationship Mapping Error
**Problem**: Circular import issue between Node and NetworkLease models causing mapper initialization failures.

**Solution**:
- Fixed relationship definitions in `flask_models.py`
- Added `lazy="select"` to prevent circular import issues
- Ensured proper string-based relationship references

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
1. `wsgi.py` - WSGI entry point for Gunicorn
2. `gunicorn.conf.py` - Production Gunicorn configuration
3. `scripts/start_production.sh` - Production startup script
4. `scripts/stop_production.sh` - Production stop script
5. `scripts/deploy_production.sh` - Full deployment automation
6. `microk8s-orchestrator.service` - Systemd service file
7. `docs/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide

### Files Modified:
1. `requirements.txt` - Added Gunicorn dependency
2. `cli.py` - Added `--production` flag for web command
3. `app/controllers/api.py` - Enhanced error handling and validation
4. `app/models/flask_models.py` - Fixed relationship mappings
5. `app/models/network_lease.py` - Added lazy loading to relationships

## Production Features Added

- Automatic worker scaling based on CPU count
- Proper timeout and connection handling
- Structured logging configuration

### 2. Deployment Automation
- Automated deployment script with system setup
- Systemd service integration
- Proper user isolation and security
- Database initialization automation

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Detailed error messages for common issues
- Validation for SSH key configuration
- Proper exception handling and logging
- User-friendly error responses

### 4. Production Scripts
- Start/stop scripts with graceful shutdown
- Status checking and monitoring
- Log viewing and debugging tools
- Service management utilities

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start (Development/Testing)
```bash
# Install Gunicorn
pip install gunicorn

# Start in production mode
python cli.py web --production

# Or use Gunicorn directly
gunicorn --config gunicorn.conf.py wsgi:application
```

### Full Production Deployment
```bash
# Automated deployment (as root)
sudo ./scripts/deploy_production.sh deploy

# Manual service management
sudo systemctl status microk8s-orchestrator
sudo journalctl -u microk8s-orchestrator -f
```

### API Error Handling
The API now provides detailed error messages:

- **SSH Key Issues**: Clear instructions for SSH key setup
- **File Not Found**: Specific file paths and resolution steps
- **Permission Errors**: Detailed permission requirements
- **Validation Errors**: Input validation with helpful suggestions

## Security Improvements

1. **User Isolation**: Dedicated `orchestrator` user for application
2. **File Permissions**: Proper SSH key and configuration permissions
3. **Systemd Security**: Limited file system access and privileges
4. **Error Information**: No sensitive data in error messages

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Worker Scaling**: Automatic worker count based on CPU cores
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Preload application for better memory usage
3. **Connection Handling**: Proper keepalive and timeout settings
4. **Lazy Loading**: Relationships loaded only when needed

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Health Checks**: Built-in health check endpoints
2. **Logging**: Structured logging for monitoring
3. **Service Management**: Systemd integration for automatic startup
4. **Backup Scripts**: Database and configuration backup utilities

## Next Steps

1. **Reverse Proxy**: Consider adding nginx/apache for HTTPS termination
2. **Database**: Consider PostgreSQL for multi-user environments
3. **Monitoring**: Add application metrics and monitoring
4. **Load Balancing**: Multiple application instances behind load balancer
5. **SSL/TLS**: Implement HTTPS for secure communication

The application is now ready for production deployment with proper WSGI server, enhanced error handling, and comprehensive deployment automation.
