## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate your help in keeping the MicroK8s Cluster Orchestrator and its users safe.

### How to Report Security Issues

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send a detailed report to [INSERT_SECURITY_EMAIL_HERE]
2. **Private GitHub Issue**: Create a private security advisory in this repository
3. **Direct Contact**: Contact the maintainers directly through GitHub

### What to Include in Your Report

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Affected versions** of the software
- **Any additional context** that might be helpful

### Response Timeline

We will acknowledge receipt of your security report within **48 hours** and provide a more detailed response within **7 days**. We'll keep you informed of our progress throughout the process.

### Security Update Process

1. **Initial Assessment** (1-2 days)
   - Review and validate the reported vulnerability
   - Assess severity and potential impact
   - Determine affected versions

2. **Development** (3-14 days depending on severity)
   - Develop and test a fix
   - Prepare security patches for supported versions
   - Create security advisory documentation

3. **Coordination** (1-3 days)
   - Coordinate with security researchers (if applicable)
   - Prepare public disclosure timeline
   - Notify relevant parties

4. **Release** (1-2 days)
   - Release security patches
   - Publish security advisory
   - Update documentation

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Installation Security

- **Verify downloads**: Always verify checksums of downloaded releases
- **Use official sources**: Only download from official GitHub releases
- **Check dependencies**: Review and update dependencies regularly
- **Use virtual environments**: Isolate the application in a virtual environment

#### Configuration Security

- **Change default secrets**: Always change default passwords and secret keys
- **Use strong authentication**: Implement strong SSH key authentication
- **Limit network access**: Restrict network access to necessary interfaces only
- **Regular updates**: Keep the application and dependencies updated

#### Production Deployment

- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production environments
- **Secure database**: Protect database files with appropriate permissions
- **Monitor logs**: Regularly review application and system logs
- **Backup security**: Secure backup files and ensure they're encrypted

### For Developers

#### Code Security

- **Input validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **SQL injection prevention**: Use parameterized queries and ORM properly
- **XSS prevention**: Escape output and use Content Security Policy
- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
- **Session security**: Use secure session management

#### Dependency Management

- **Regular updates**: Keep dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- **Vulnerability scanning**: Use tools to scan for known vulnerabilities
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only include necessary dependencies
- **License compliance**: Ensure all dependencies have compatible licenses

#### Infrastructure Security

- **Secrets management**: Never commit secrets to version control
- **Access control**: Implement proper access controls and permissions
- **Network security**: Use firewalls and network segmentation
- **Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring and alerting

## Known Security Considerations

### SSH Key Management

- **Key rotation**: Regularly rotate SSH keys for cluster nodes
- **Key storage**: Store private keys securely with appropriate permissions
- **Key distribution**: Use secure methods to distribute public keys
- **Key validation**: Validate SSH key fingerprints before use

### Database Security

- **File permissions**: Ensure database files have restrictive permissions
- **Backup encryption**: Encrypt database backups
- **Access control**: Limit database access to authorized users only
- **Regular backups**: Maintain regular, secure backups

### Network Security

- **Firewall configuration**: Properly configure firewalls for cluster nodes
- **Network segmentation**: Isolate cluster networks from other systems
- **TLS/SSL**: Use encrypted connections for all network communication
- **Port security**: Only open necessary ports and services

### Ansible Security

- **Vault usage**: Use Ansible Vault for sensitive data
- **Playbook validation**: Validate Ansible playbooks before execution
- **Host key verification**: Verify host keys for all managed nodes
- **Privilege escalation**: Use minimal required privileges

## Security Updates

### Automatic Updates

The application does not include automatic update functionality. Users should:

- **Monitor releases**: Watch the GitHub repository for new releases
- **Test updates**: Test updates in non-production environments first
- **Plan maintenance**: Schedule regular maintenance windows for updates
- **Backup before updates**: Always backup data before applying updates

### Update Notifications

- **GitHub releases**: New releases are announced via GitHub releases
- **Security advisories**: Security issues are published as GitHub security advisories
- **Documentation**: Security-related changes are documented in release notes

## Security Contact
